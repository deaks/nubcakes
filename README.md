# Baking Nubcakes

This project contains training material sufficient to indoctrinate
newbies and facilitate more in-depth conversations, engagements, and
learning in the domains  of computer science, programming, network
protocols, and computer security; i.e. "baking a nubcake".

## Recipie

Content is prepared as a sequence of modules (ingredients) and is
intended to be consumed in the sequence described here.

Topical content labels have been added to support topical exploration
of the material and lookups for reference purposes.

The numbering scheme used for content modules follows the digits of
[Euler's number **_e_**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant),
an irrational and transcendental constant (sequence
[A001113](https://oeis.org/A001113) in the
[OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences OEIS)),
because using **_Ï€_** would possibly be taking the analogy too far.
