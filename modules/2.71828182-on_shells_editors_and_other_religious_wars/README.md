# On Shells, Editors, and other Religious Wars

This playful module takes on the topics that have historically devolved
into flame wars between otherwise sane developers over the decades.


## deaks corner -- war of the shells

sh/dash, ksh, csh, bash, zsh; pick sh/dash and any other it is generally OK ignore the rest


## deaks corner -- war of the editors

vi(m) vs. nano/pico vs. emacs; gvim vs. gedit vs. xemacs; fancy editor, IDE, or neither? (Eclipse inherits the world, slowly losing traction to specialized editors); learn enough vim to do basic editing, go from there as whim/opportunity/interest takes you


## deaks corner -- war of the programming languages

it used to be lisp, perl, c, c++, or java when I was in school with ada and fortran seemingly on the way out and cobol already relegated to utter darkness; oddball things like ml, prolog, seemed reserved for specific uses as were non-trivial scripts using awk, sed, bc

now it seems to be javascript, ruby, or some more convenient JVM dialect like groovy at the fore with python/c++/java in the middle and c still poking around under the covers in a lot of places; oddball things are still lurking and have new additions like haskell while ada and fortran seem to finally be joining cobol in the darkness


## deaks corner -- whitespace and preservation of tabs

when are tabs important? when can they be harmful?


## deaks corner -- regular expression syntax

SED vs. PCRE vs. some other thing


## deaks corner -- SYSV init (legacy) vs. upstart (Ubuntu 12.04) vs. systemd (Ubuntu 16.x, EL7.x)

improvements, migration pain, oddities (async start on systemd is both a boon and a fail)
