# DNS, NTP, SNMP, and SMTP

This module explores some of the basic application protocols used to
manage hosts and devices on a computer network and to send electronic
mail.


## deaks corner -- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Request For Comments (RFC) documents and standards and protocol specifications

introduction to the IETF, introduction to the RFC concept, list of RFCs
for protocols discussed so far Ethernet, ICMP, UDP, TCP


## Domain Name System (DNS)

## Network Time Protocol (NTP)

brief discussion of denial-of-service vulnerabilities disclosed in 2015
for NTP which necessitated patches for Unix or Linux-based operating
system variants; we think of these protocols as being pretty well baked
but the implementations used in practice still have imperfections in
part due to the human condition and our fallibility


## deaks corner -- Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 1588-2008 (IEEE-1588v2) and the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)

brief discussion of modern replacement for NTP including protocol
additions to support secure lookups, however due to the new-ness of
implementations many still rely in NTP which is more of a known
quantity (people understand how to work around many failings of mature
protocols and simply avoid relying on them in those cases)


## Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

## Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
