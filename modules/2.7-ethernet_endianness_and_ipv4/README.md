Ethernet, Endian-ness, and the Internet Protcol (v4)

Ethernet CSMA and CSMA/CD protocol, shared media and collisions (hub/repeater, taps), collision management with switches (switch/bridge), Ethernet MAC addressing and broadcast, collision/broadcast domain, the "LAN" concept

deaks on pseudocode and metasyntactic.variables: $var, {var}, A[idx], M[row][col] (except FORTRAN and MATLAB, sigh), <required> and [ optional ], foo/bar/baz/qux

deaks on endian-ness: big endian, little endian, bi-endian; archaic: PDP endian

IP(v4): classical network organization (classful) and modern  (classless, CIDR) subnetting concepts and practice; network/broadcast addresses of a subnet, local broadcast address; private network ranges, network byte order

LAN/WAN concepts: routing (router, gateway, default route)

IPv4 and DHCP: 

deaks on IPv4 directed broadcast: directed broadcast to a remote subnet, opt-in
